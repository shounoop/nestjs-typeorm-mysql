# NestJS-MySQL-TypeORM Project

- This is a sample project built using NestJS, a popular Node.js framework, to interact with a MySQL database using the TypeORM ORM library. The project is designed to provide a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing users, with endpoints for retrieving user data, creating new users, updating existing users, and deleting users.

- The project uses NestJS's modular architecture to separate concerns and maintain code organization. The app module is responsible for bootstrapping the application, while the user module handles user-related functionality. The controller and service files within the user module implement the CRUD operations, while the entity files define the database schema using TypeORM's decorators.

- TypeORM is used to handle the database interactions, providing an object-relational mapping layer that allows developers to work with the database using TypeScript classes and objects. This makes it easy to write type-safe, maintainable code that interacts with the database.

- The project also includes unit tests to ensure that the functionality is working as intended. These tests use the Jest testing framework, which is integrated with NestJS out of the box.

- Overall, this project is a great starting point for anyone looking to build a Node.js application with a MySQL database and TypeORM. It provides a solid foundation for building more complex applications and can be easily extended with additional modules and functionality. The project is hosted on GitHub, making it easy for other developers to fork and contribute.
